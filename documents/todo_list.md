## Todo List with Checkboxes

### Setup and Environment Preparation
- [x] Install necessary development tools (e.g., IDE, Git, etc.).
- [x] Set up a version control repository.
- [x] Create a project folder structure.
- [x] Verify Python installation and dependencies.
- [x] Install required libraries (e.g., Pygame, etc.).
- [x] Test basic Pygame setup.
- [x] Create a virtual environment for the project.
- [x] Write a README file for the project.
- [x] Document initial project goals.
- [x] Create a basic `.gitignore` file.

### GPIO Module Mock Creation for Windows
- [x] Research GPIO module functionality and requirements.
- [x] Define the interface for the GPIO mock module.
- [x] Implement basic GPIO mock methods (e.g., `setup`, `input`, `output`).
- [x] Simulate GPIO pin states in the mock.
- [ ] Add logging to track GPIO interactions.
- [ ] Test the GPIO mock with a sample script.
- [x] Integrate the GPIO mock into the game project.
- [x] Verify compatibility with Windows.
- [ ] Document the GPIO mock implementation.
- [ ] Ensure the mock can be easily replaced with the real GPIO module.


### Class Refactoring for Shared Features
- [ ] Identify shared features between Color Memory and Color Reflex.
- [ ] Create a base class for shared features.
- [ ] Implement shared color display logic in the base class.
- [ ] Add shared scoring logic to the base class.
- [ ] Refactor Color Memory to use the base class.
- [ ] Refactor Color Reflex to use the base class.
- [ ] Test Color Memory with the refactored base class.
- [ ] Test Color Reflex with the refactored base class.
- [ ] Document the refactored class structure.
- [ ] Optimize the base class for performance.

### Testing and Debugging
- [ ] Write unit tests for the base class.
- [ ] Write unit tests for Color Memory.
- [ ] Write unit tests for Color Reflex.
- [ ] Test the game on Windows.
- [ ] Debug any platform-specific issues.
- [ ] Test the game on different screen resolutions.
- [ ] Verify the timer functionality.
- [ ] Verify the scoring system.
- [ ] Test user interactions with the UI.
- [ ] Fix any bugs found during testing.

### Finalization and Review
- [ ] Polish the UI design.
- [ ] Add final sound effects.
- [ ] Optimize the game loop for performance.
- [ ] Write a user manual for the game.
