  ```
  > `sudo` is required to access `rpi_ws281x` (LED control).

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, check the [Issues page](https://github.com/rikutoyamada01/color_games/issues) to report bugs or get help.

### Problem: Can't install a module on Raspberry Pi under restricted access

If your Raspberry Pi is heavily managed or locked down, this command may fail:
```sh
sudo apt-get install python3-opencv
```

✅ **Solution:** Use `pip` instead:
```sh
sudo pip3 install python3-opencv
```
